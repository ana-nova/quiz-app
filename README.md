# Quiz App

I built this ðŸ§  Quiz App to flex my JS, HTML, and CSS skills! Itâ€™s all about coding, quizzes, and having fun while learning. Ready to see what Iâ€™ve put together? Letâ€™s dive in! âœ¨

## My epic plan 

### **Epic 1: Create basic design with CSS**
- A header, main content, and footer have been implemented.
- The header is fixed, displaying the title "Quiz App" and includes a navigation bar.
- The main content contains quiz cards that show questions, answers, and tags.
- The footer includes links to the homepage and a bookmarks page.
- Primary colors and text styles (background colors, text colors, and button colors) have been defined.
- Font types and sizes are set.
- The design is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

### **Epic 2: User interaction and bookmark feature**

- Each quiz card contains a question with a hidden answer.
- Clicking the "Show Answer" button reveals the answer.
- Clicking the "Hide Answer" button hides the answer again.
- Each quiz has a heart icon that toggles between a filled and empty heart when clicked.
- Clicking the heart icon bookmarks the question.
- Bookmarked questions are displayed on a separate "Bookmarks" page.

### **Epic 3: Add dynamic quiz creation by using forms**

- A form has been provided for users to create new quiz questions and answers.
- The form includes input fields for the question, answer, and tags.
- A "Submit" button processes the input and displays the new quiz card in the main content.
- The form ensures that both the question and answer are entered.
- Maximum character limits have been defined for the input fields.
- If inputs are invalid, an error message is displayed.

## My ToDos:

### **Epic 4: Responsive Design**
- Ensure that the layout adapts to different screen sizes, adjusting content for mobile, tablet, and desktop views using media queries.

---

### **Epic 5: Accessibility**
- The app should be developed with a focus on accessibility, including ARIA labels for key interactive elements.

---

### **Epic 6: Add a star rating system**
- Each quiz card should include a 5-star rating system, where users can fill stars by clicking on them.
- Ratings should be stored independently for each question.

---

### **Epic 7: Provide feedback on answers**
- After a user reveals the answer, provide immediate feedback (e.g., "Correct!" or "Try again!") or simply show points
